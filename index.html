    <p>From the Crunchyroll website: "Spurred by the flame raging in his heart, the Black Swordsman Guts
        continues his seemingly endless quest for revenge. Standing in his
        path are heinous outlaws, delusional evil spirits, and a devout child
        of god. Even as it chips away at his life, Guts continues to fight his
        enemies, who wield repulsive and inhumane power, with nary but his body
        and swordâ€”his strength as a human. What lies at the end of his travels?
        The answer is shrouded in the "night." Strain your eyes and stare into the dark!" </p>
